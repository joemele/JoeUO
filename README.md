**Update  I started to finally work on the code. but Decided to start from divinity source code. This repo is in this account**
based on RunUO 2.2 


I just want to bring some sanity to code. 

Goals
===================
1) make it extensible
2) generalize it a server for any type of game
3) interface with a db to track the economy to finally see how to not break the economy
